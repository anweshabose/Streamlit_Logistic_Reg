To run the code we have to command "streamlit run 2-Streamlit.py" in the terminal.
It may ask you to provide the email address... please provide it.
Then it will redirect you to Google Chrome.

You can upload any csv file as per your wish. 
Only those kind of csv should be uploaded by which you can predict something like Salary of employees, House Price.. etc. Not any unnecessary csv.
Then enter your target column i.e. the dependent column like Salary of employees, House Price. (you can choose only one column as your target column)
Then enter other independent columns (like Experience, Education level are indicators about how much salary an employee is supposed to get)

Enter numbers that you actually want to predict.
Atlast "Predicted class" will give you the result of prediction. (say, price of the house or salary of employee)
